<h2><a name="41">[ANN] iPOPO 1.0.0</a></h2>
<pre>Hi,

I'm happy to announce that iPOPO v1.0.0 has finally been released!

What is iPOPO
=============

iPOPO is a Service-Oriented Component Model (SOCM) based on Pelix,
a dynamic service platform. Both are inspired on two popular Java
technologies for the development of long-lived applications:
the iPOJO component model and the OSGi Service Platform.
iPOPO enables to conceive long-running and modular IT services.

It is based on the concepts specified by OSGi:
  - Bundle: a Python module imported using Pelix and associated to a
  context. A bundle has a life-cycle (install, start, updated, stop,
  uninstall)
  - Service: a Python object registered in a service registry,
  associated to a specification and to properties.
  - Component: the instance of a class described/manipulated by iPOPO
  decorators

Components are bound together by the specification(s) of the service(s)
they provide. The required services are injected into components by iPOPO.

For more information about those concepts, see
https://ipopo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/refcards/index.html#refcards


iPOPO provides many services out-of-the-box, like an HTTP server,
local and remote shell, remote services...

iPOPO is released under the terms of Apache Software License 2.0


What's new in 1.0.0
===================

This is the first "major" release of iPOPO, as I consider it mature enough.

The Pelix/iPOPO project is now split in two branches: iPOPO (v1 branch) and
ipopo2 (v2 branch). The v2 branch will require Python 3.7+, whereas v1 will keep
compatibility with Python 2.7.

Also, this release comes with two bug fixes:

* Fixed an error when starting the framework after having loaded native modules,
  e.g. numpy.
  These modules don't have a __path__ set, which case was not handled when the
  framework normalizes the existing module paths.
* Fixed an invalid import of collections abstract classes for Python 3.3+
  in pelix.internal.hooks.


You can take a look at the documentation at https://ipopo.readthedocs.io/
iPOPO is available on PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/iPOPO
Source is available on GitHub: https://github.com/tcalmant/ipopo
Feel free to send feedback on your experience of Pelix/iPOPO, via the
mailing lists:

    User list : http://groups.google.com/group/ipopo-users
    Development list : http://groups.google.com/group/ipopo-dev

Have fun!
